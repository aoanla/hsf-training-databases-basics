The example-based nature of [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/) is GREAT.

Matplotlib is the standard when it comes to making plots in Python. It is versatile and allows for lots of functionality and different ways to produce many plots.
We will be focusing on using matplotlib for High Energy Physics.

# A simple example

As with any Python code it is always good practice to import the necessary libraries as a first step.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
