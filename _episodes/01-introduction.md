# What is a database?

A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. The data is typically organized to model relevant
characteristics of the information contained in the database.
For example, a database that contains information on members of a collaboration might be organized to model
the institutions they belong to, and the publications they have authored, the relationships between the members, etc.

# Database management systems

A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications,
and the database itself to capture and analyze data.

A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.
